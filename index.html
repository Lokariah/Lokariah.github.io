           <p class='hidden popUpdesc'> The project aims to develop a DirectX12 engine capable of rendering a scene through both rasterising and ray tracing. The project shares between both sides the same device objects and toggle between both sides through a bool. Both sides are capable of rendering dynamic objects with blinn-phong lighting.

           <p class='hidden popUpdesc'> The project achieves real time water simulation through simulating the amplitudes of waves and applying to a height grid dynamic vertex buffer. The simulation replicates reflection and refraction through cube maps, utilising the Fresnel equation to combine the two realistically and achieve the final output.

The game features a spaceship being tasked with delivering goods to random stations while defending themselves from oncoming enemies and was made in UE5.

           <p class='hidden popUpdesc'> The project was an exercise in optimisation, utilising Data oriented design, multithreading, and line sweeps to simulate the collision of a extremely large amount of circles in real time with no loss in simulation quality. The project can simulate 100,000 independent spheres at an average frame rate of 62 fps.
